# What is it?
The default bibtex exports from Semantic Scholar libraries do not include DOIs, which is problematic for some. This simple CLI app scratches that itch for you. You may find it useful to ask Zotero SciHub plugin to fetch PDFs.


# How to use

1. Install the deps
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run in CLI
   ```
   python doi_lookup.py my_semantic_scholar_exported.bib
   ```
3. Check the results.
